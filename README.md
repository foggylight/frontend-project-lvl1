# Brain Games [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/60b92975fae102282963/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/foggylight/frontend-project-lvl1/maintainability) [![Brain Games](https://github.com/foggylight/frontend-project-lvl1/workflows/Brain%20Games/badge.svg)](https://github.com/foggylight/frontend-project-lvl1/actions)

Here is the set of five console games, these games work on the same principle as popular mobile brain training apps. Each game asks questions and you need to answer it correctly. You win the game after giving the right answers to three questions in a row. If your answer is wrong, the game will be over, but you can try again!

Games:
- [Even parity](#even-parity) - Is given number even?
- [Calculator](#calculator) - You should calculate the result of arithmetic expression.
- [GCD](#gcd) (greatest common divisor) - Find the largest integer number that divides given numbers without remainder.
- [Arithmetical progression](#arithmetical-progression) - Find the skipped number in sequence.
- [Prime numbers](#prime-numbers) - Is given number prime?

## Installation

To run games go into the package directory and use npm command:

```
$ npm link
```
